NAME
    GPS::Lowrance::Trail - Convert between Lowrance GDM16 Trail Files

REQUIREMENTS
    "GPS::Lowrance::Trail" was written and tested on Perl 5.6.1, though it
    should work with v5.005.

    It uses only standard modules.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    There is no test suite to speak of. One will be added in a later
    version.

SYNOPSIS
      use GPS::Lowrance::Trail;

      my $trail = new GPS::Lowrance::Trail;

      my $fh1 = new FileHandle '<lowrance.txt';
      my $fh2 = new FileHandle '>lonlat.txt';

      $trail->read_gdm16( $fh1 );      # read GDM16 Trail Exports

      $trail->write_lonlat( $fh2 );    # write as Longitude/Latitude file

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows one to convert between Lowrance GPS trail files
    (handled by the GDM16 application) and Longitude/Lattitude files which
    may be used by mapping applications.


CAVEATS
    This module comes from a quick and dirty hack adapted from a one-off
    script written for this purpose. It appears to work, but has not been
    fully tested.

    More features and file formats may be added in the future.
